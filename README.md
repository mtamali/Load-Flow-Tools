The analysis of the distribution of power in an electric network consisting of a number of generators, transmission lines, and loads is very important for studies, planning and operation of electrical network. This allows, to know the conditions of production and load levels and network voltages. Calculations to obtain this information is known (or flow of power load flow or power flow). The power flow study coordinates the use of all resources energy and the distribution of production to different users, which aims to obtain the most economical operation leading to better utilization of all resources, forecasts of consumption and production were made by depth studies, using digital methods applied in this area to solve this problem it is necessary to determine the conditions for the steady state operation of a power system are: -The Formulation of a suitable mathematical model.

- The specification of a number of variable and constraint nodes in the system.
- The digital system resolution.
